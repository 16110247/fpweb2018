                            <h1>Phantom 2 Vision Plus</h1>
                            <p>More powerful than your average toy quadcopter, but not as intimidating as DIY enthusiast models, the DJI Phantom 2 Vision+ falls in a sweet spot for anyone who wants to get started capturing videos and photos from the sky.</p>
                            <p>Well, anyone who has $1,160 to spare on a new hobby anyway. (It'll set you back around Â£890 in the UK and in Australia about AU$1,300.) But, that's a fairly reasonable price considering how ready-to-fly and shoot the Vision+ is out of the box.</p>
                            <p>If you don't stop to charge up its batteries or read the manual (you should do both before your first flight, of course), you can go from unpacking it to up in the air inside of 10 minutes.</p>
                            <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                            <p>Again, there's not much to setting up the Vision+ for the first time. The propellers have to be spun on, but they're clearly marked so you don't do it incorrectly and they're self-tightening so they lock on as soon as the copter spins up for take-off.</p>
                            <p>There are three things you'll need to charge up before you fly: the Vision+ battery pack, the wireless range extender and an Android or iOS mobile device. The remote control also needs four, AA-size batteries.</p>
                            <p>The copter's battery is charged via an included wall charger or an optional car charger, while the range extender pulls its power from a Micro-USB port connected to a computer or wall adapter (not included). It would be nice if both could get topped off from one charger giving you a bit of a reminder, but it's just something you'll have to make a habit of before you fly.</p>
                            <h1>Time To Fly</h1>
                            <p>Whether you've already bought the Vision+ or are still in the consideration phase, I recommended downloading and reading through the full user manual and flight training guide available on DJI's support site.</p>
                            <p>To get ready to fly, you'll have to power on the Vision+, the remote control and the wireless range extender. Once the extender is ready (it takes about 30 seconds), you'll connect your phone's Wi-Fi to it and then open the Vision app.</p>
                            <p>The key piece that makes the Vision+ easy to fly for beginners is the built-in DJI Naza-M flight control system. It's made up of an inertial sensor, barometric altimeter, a compass, GPS, LED flight indicators and a controller that gets them all to work together.</p>
                            <p>After a quick calibration of the compass -- something you'll do before every new flight -- that requires little more than rotating the copter once horizontally and once vertically, you'll be ready to take off.</p>
